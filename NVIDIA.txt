Wayland is not shown as an option on the login screen (or the cog icon of the login screen doesn't show at all)
Edit the /etc/gdm3/custom.conf file using sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
Ensure that WaylandEnable=true is set in that file and make sure that it's uncommented (does not start with a #)
Run sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules
Reboot the system
